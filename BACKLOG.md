## Ranking integrity

- **A prespeed start-box load still arms CLEAN on the 6 regions where `%.4f`
  rounding hides the zone** -- Patch 435 answered the velocity where Build 47's
  gate can fire (`tools/census/startdest.py`: 29 of 35 shipped regions with an
  authored teleDestPos), and on the other 6 -- 3 maps, bhop_eazy,
  kz_bkz_goldbhop_v2, surf_friday -- SV_ZoneStartAt answers -1, so neither the
  gate nor Patch 435's row-speed condition is reached. THERE THE HOP IS THE
  ROUTE, and only on a non-bhop mode: `cfg/test/p435mode.cfg`
  (`python tools/p435pre.py --arm mode`) measures a prespeed load + `+jump` with
  `sv_gamemode surf` arming at z 106.9 against a slab bottom of 64.03125 and
  reading `arm zone 0`, `practice 0`, `class: clean`. `cfg/test/p435hop.cfg`
  (`--arm shipped`) tried to measure the same gesture in bhop mode and DID NOT
  DEMONSTRATE it: its own control (H3, the at-rest save loaded and jumped) came
  back tainted, which is verbatim that cfg's `FALSIFIED IF`, because on
  bhop_eazy's shipped zones no start-box load arms clean at all -- the rounding
  above. So on a bhop-mode map the question is OPEN. The mechanism that would
  answer it is readable in the code (SV_TimerTryArm's `run_t_bhopjump` branch
  refuses to arm an attempt already RUNNING, so the jump starts the run from the
  restored ARMED state instead of arming it) but it is not measured, and the
  entry this replaces claimed the hop beat the rounding EVERYWHERE, which is
  false only for the surf-mode half. A SOUND ARM is p435hop's gestures in bhop
  mode with `cfg/test/p435.zones.json` staged so the control can arm clean -- the
  same fixture p435pre and p441void use -- or one of the 6 exposed regions'
  own maps. `tools/p435pre.py --arm shipped` now exits 1 with NOT DEMONSTRATED
  rather than grading H3 against the failed reading (Patch 441). The fix has to answer the
  velocity where the gate cannot see it: either zero the inherited speed at a
  start-box placement under a TOLERANT box test (body AND the hold's
  `rec_sl_holdvel`, or the release hands it straight back), or a load-scoped mark
  SV_TimerArm refuses to launder while it stands -- cleared by the body being
  slow, NOT while `rec_sl_hold`, and never at SV_TimerArm itself, because on a
  surf map flying into a start box arms you clean at speed by design (Patch 415's
  essay) and a speed test there would taint every honest re-entry.
  PATCH 442 CLOSED THE VERTICAL HALF of the gate's blindness, which is not the
  same as closing this: SL_RowSpeed measured horizontal speed only, so a save
  taken MID-JUMP inside a start box (vz +302, nothing horizontal) read as at rest
  and laundered -- measured both ways, `cfg/test/p442jump.cfg`. The gate can no
  longer be told a rising body is at rest, and `sl_list` no longer prints such a
  row as `0 u/s standing`. A load carrying speed still hands that speed back, as
  a segmented run, so the placement answer above is still the open item.
  sv_timer.qc SV_TimerTryArm / SV_TimerArm, sv_saveloc.qc SV_SaveLocLoad,
  SL_RowSpeed. Patch 435, part-closed by 442.
- **EVERY LOAD AND EVERY RETRY TURNS THE HOPPED-START RULE OFF, and on the retry
  path the run stays CLEAN.** `SV_SaveApplyState` sets `e.run_t_startok = TRUE`
  unconditionally (sv_saveloc.qc:1287) and the whole Build 19/20/21 start rule --
  the settle, the dwell, the `hopped start` verdict, `run_t_hopped` -- lives behind
  `if (!e.run_t_startok)` (sv_timer.qc:9986). Only SV_TimerArm clears it again
  (sv_timer.qc:10509). A LOAD is practice, so there it costs nothing; a RETRY
  restores `run_t_flags`/`dirty`/`cheat` verbatim and calls no SV_TimerStitched, so
  the attempt is clean and rankable with the rule off until something re-arms it.
  Gesture, alone on a server with `rec_retry 1` (the default): stand ARMED and clean
  in the start box, `retry`, and after the restart bhop-chain inside the box before
  leaving. On a leave-the-box map that is an unbounded chain for free; on a
  start-on-jump map it is the first launch. One keypress, no cheats, no cvars.
  Found by the review of Patch 441 round 2, in code neither 441 nor 442 touches.
- **The retry placement is a second copy of the start-box velocity restore, with no
  gate on it at all.** `SV_SaveApplyState`'s retry branch places the body from the
  file's `origin`/`velocity` (sv_saveloc.qc:1194-1210) and restores the flags
  verbatim (:1395) -- no SV_TimerStitched, no SL_RowSpeed test, no SV_ZoneStartAt
  test, no `sl_voided` check, no demoted re-scan. Patch 442 hardened SL_RowSpeed,
  which has exactly one caller: the SV_SaveLocLoad gate. So: re-enter your own start
  box while RUNNING (with `run_rearmstops 1` SV_TimerTryArm re-arms without zeroing
  velocity), `retry` there, and the restart hands back ARMED + clean + that velocity,
  up to `sv_maxvelocity`. Prespeed injection into a clean armed attempt, repeatable,
  and with the entry above the hop rule is off too. Its only brake is that `retry`
  refuses with more than one player on the lobby. Patch 441 review.
- **The start-box gate asks about SPEED and never about SUPPORT, so a save taken
  AIRBORNE with |v| < 1 still arms clean.** Patch 442 made SL_RowSpeed read all
  three components, which closes the mid-jump case, but the row carries no ground
  state and SV_SaveLocLoad clears FL_ONGROUND for every load (sv_saveloc.qc:2374) --
  so a body hanging in mid-air inside the slab satisfies the test as well as one
  standing on the floor. Deterministic ways to be off the ground under 1 u/s: WATER
  (`sv_waterfriction`/`watersinkspeed` decay velocity continuously through 1 at any
  height), a LADDER (`pm_ladders 1`: release the keys and velocity is zero), a jump
  into a low ceiling (the clip removes vz in one move), and a tuned apex frame (the
  per-move step is gravity x the usercmd's msec, which the client's framerate
  chooses). What it buys is the fall -- up to the slab's height, 160 u on bhop_eazy
  and up to 189 u of authored destination elsewhere -- free, because the clock does
  not start until the hull leaves the box. WORSE, it defeats the accident that
  protects most maps: Patch 415's `%.4f` rounding puts a GROUNDED placed body 5e-5
  below the slab on 6 of 35 authored regions, but an airborne row's z is genuinely
  inside it. The fix wants a support test at the placement (a downward tracebox at
  the placed origin), not another threshold. And note the other direction is
  untested: a save taken floating in water reads ~60 u/s and the gate correctly
  refuses it, but nothing measures that. sv_saveloc.qc SL_RowSpeed and the gate in
  SV_SaveLocLoad. Patch 442 review.
- **`sl_replay`'s taint does not survive the next arm, and it has no resume guard.**
  Patch 441 round 2 added SV_TimerPractice at the gesture so the command's safety is
  local rather than inherited from the cheatwatch blocks. It covers the attempt in
  progress only: SV_TimerArm re-derives the class from the level (sv_timer.qc:10566)
  and the retry/Multi-Session restores put back the saved flags, so `sl_replay` then
  `!r` clears it -- the same scope every other taint has, but the comment claims
  more. `SV_SaveLocReplay` also lacks the `run_ms_phase` refusal SV_SaveLocLoad has
  (sv_saveloc.qc:2299), so it can taint a run mid-resume. Patch 441 review.
- **`SV_RetryPoint` ignores `SV_RecDestream`'s return, so a failed destream writes a
  retry point that claims nothing was being recorded.** SV_RecDestream reads a
  streamed run's part file back into a buffer and returns FALSE -- after calling
  SV_RecDiscard -- when it cannot. SV_RetryPoint discards that answer and writes
  `state.txt` anyway, with TF_RECORDING clear and `reclines 0`, so none of Patch
  441's three clauses can see that this run WAS recording: with `rec_enable 0` the
  retry then carries a clean, rankable, RUNNING attempt across the restart with no
  recording. The fix is at the call (refuse the retry, or void the run) or by carrying
  "was recording" in the `rec_retry_armed` cvar the arming flag already travels in.
  Needs a stream -- a lobby, or `rec_stream 1` on a listen server, which is what
  would make it measurable. sv_saveloc.qc SV_RetryPoint, sv_timer.qc:5573.
  Patch 441 review, round 4.
- **`reclines` IS NOT EVIDENCE THE PREFIX FILE EXISTS, and nothing that reads it
  knows.** SV_RecWritePrefix returns its line count after `fopen`+`buf_writefile`+
  `fclose`, and QC cannot see any of those fail: the engine's PF_fopen allocates a
  MEMORY BUFFER for the write modes and the bytes leave at fclose, unchecked. Proved
  by staging a DIRECTORY on the retry slot's `run.rec` path -- the log shows the
  `fopen` succeeding, no `timer: cannot write` line, the directory still a directory
  at exit, and `reclines` positive in the state file with no prefix anywhere
  (`cfg/test/p441retryw.cfg`). So `SV_RecWritePrefix`'s `if (fh < 0)` branch is
  effectively unreachable for a filesystem fault, and every reader that treats
  `reclines > 0` as "there is a file" is trusting a count written before the bytes
  left the process -- Patch 426's reasoning about mark-0 saves, a verifier pairing a
  state file with a recording, and any future predicate tempted by `mark`. The fix
  wants the writer to confirm the file (a `fsize` of the path after fclose, or a
  `recbytes` it checks) before it reports a count. sv_timer.qc SV_RecWritePrefix,
  engine PF_fopen. Patch 441 round 6.
- **TF_RECORDING can be left set with no recorder behind it.**
  SV_RecRewindStream's two cold-failure exits destroy the old recorder and return
  FALSE without clearing the bit, and SV_RecClose early-returns on `!SV_RecLive`
  without clearing it either. Inside SV_SaveApplyState both arms discard, so it is
  always reconciled there -- but SV_MsRecAttach's buffer branch returns without a
  discard, leaving a RUNNING run with the bit set and no recorder, and a later
  `retry` then writes that stale bit into its state file where Patch 441's third
  clause reads it. The void is still right in substance there (evidence really was
  lost, a session earlier), so this is "right for the wrong reason" rather than a
  false accusation -- but the bit is being trusted as a fact about now.
  sv_timer.qc SV_RecRewindStream, SV_RecClose; sv_resume.qc SV_MsRecAttach.
  Patch 441 review, round 5.
- **The cancel message names the wrong reason for a run that never had a recording.**
  Patch 441's clause 1 cancels a RUNNING attempt with no recorder on a server that
  records -- deliberately, and even when the run never had one (armed while
  rec_enable was 0, the operator turns it on, the player loads). The player then
  reads `run cancelled (the save's recording could not be restored)`, which asserts
  something false: there was none to restore. One string, two causes. The fix is a
  second reason word at the SV_TimerVoid call, and it touches what seven arms grade,
  which is why it is here rather than done. sv_saveloc.qc, the failed-rewind branch.
  Patch 441 review, round 5.
- **`sl_list` prints the row speed as `%4.0f`, so the arming boundary is invisible.**
  A row carrying 0.6 u/s prints `1 u/s` and arms; one carrying 1.4 prints `1 u/s`
  and does not (SL_ARM_SPEED is 1). Patch 442 widened this column to the whole
  vector, which is what makes it worth reading at all -- and then it rounds away the
  one distinction a player would use it for. One decimal, or print the row's arming
  answer beside it. sv_saveloc.qc SV_SaveLocList. Patch 442 review.
- **The void's "leave the box and enter it" is satisfiable by the velocity the
  same load restores.** Patch 441 re-scans the occupancy latches after a failed
  rewind so a cancelled run does not come back armed; the remedy assumes the
  player has to travel. A save taken just OUTSIDE a start box with its velocity
  pointed in gives `zs_az = -1` at the re-scan and an arm edge on the next tick as
  the body coasts in -- a clean arm, then the clock starts on the way out at the
  saved speed. Reachable without any void at all (load a non-RUNNING save outside
  the box), so it is not new, but the patch's stated remedy is weaker than "you
  must walk". sv_saveloc.qc SV_SaveApplyState's void branch. Patch 441 review.
- **The Multi-Session resume continues a RUNNING run with no recorder, under a
  flag that is not a taint.** `SV_SaveApplyState` returns at `if (retry == 2)`
  BEFORE the failed-rewind branch Patch 434/441 guard, and `run_ms_norec` leaves
  the attempt running while marking it only TF_MULTISESSION -- which sh_defs.qc
  and surfd both state is not a class, not in FS_RunClass or TF_UNCERT, and not
  read by surfd's `style_of`/`certifiable`. So a clean run whose `.rec` stops at
  the pause can rank. The size trigger (`run_resume_recmb` 512 MB) is out of
  reach; the live route is the copy-failure branch. Same absence decision as
  Patch 441's, resolved the other way, in code 441's own reasoning covers.
  AND THE BUFFER PATH HAS ITS OWN: `SV_MsRecAttach`'s `if (!ok) return;` after
  SV_RecRewind leaves a restored TS_RUNNING run with no recorder and no void, since
  SV_SaveApplyState returns at `retry == 2` before the branch Patches 434 and 441
  guard. `run_ms_norec` is the only thing standing there. Named by the fourth
  review round. sv_resume.qc:531-537, 573, 678. Patch 441 review.
- **At `run_zone_hull 2` + `run_zone_hull_live 1`, Patch 441's latch re-scan uses
  the PRE-load hull.** It passes `SV_RunHullMaxs(e)`, i.e. `e.maxs`, but
  SV_SaveLocPlace only sets `run_forceduck` -- the engine applies it in the next
  pmove -- so the re-scanned latch and the next tick's scan can disagree by the
  17-unit stand/duck difference, which is an arm edge, which is the laundering
  back. Inert at the shipped defaults (occupancy is a point test there and the
  hull arguments are ignored), so this is a note against those two cvars being
  turned on, not a live hole. sv_saveloc.qc SV_SaveApplyState. Patch 441 review.
- **Map triggers still touch a held (save-lock) body.** The engine skips touches
  only for `run_pmhold`; push-once triggers are spent for everyone, and every
  other trigger that writes velocity does so into a body nobody is steering. The
  timer ignores it since Patch 428 round 6, the side effects remain.
  PARTLY CLOSED BY READING, NOT BY A MEASUREMENT ON DISK: the func_bhop dwell
  the entry named should not fire on a held body (a save-lock hold is
  MOVETYPE_NONE, the mover runs PM_NONE for it, PM_NONE clears FL_ONGROUND and
  nothing writes .groundentity again, so SV_BhopFrame reads `ground 0` on every
  held frame and the dwell never arms). That chain is checkable in the sources
  cited below. THE MEASUREMENT IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE, though, and the entry said it
  was: the one-shot print it quotes (`bhop frame first: ground 0 isbhop 0
  movetype 0 slheld 1`) exists nowhere in `src/` -- it was instrumentation that
  did not survive the patch -- and the only instance of that print anywhere in
  ftesurf/logs reads `movetype 3 slheld 0` (p439svAO.log:143), i.e. an unheld
  walking body, not a held one. To close it for real: put the dprint back in
  SV_BhopFrame behind `developer`, drive p439cl.cfg's route, and grade the line. The half that is
  still open is the triggers a HELD body is already touching, and the
  push-once spend: those need the engine's `run_pmhold`-style skip to cover a
  save-lock hold too, which is an engine change.
  sv_entities.qc SV_BhopFrame, engine sv_user.c:8097 (MOVETYPE_NONE -> PM_NONE),
  sv_user.c:8887 (.groundentity written only when pmove.onground).
  Patch 428 review.

## Performance

- **A 999-save rescan is synchronous: 157 ms on the Pi** (profile_ssqc,
  p428cl). Once per player per map, plus once per reconnect with another
  certificate -- alternating two certificates with 999 saves each is a
  player-ordered stall. Half is the directory walk (one search_begin), so the
  fix is an index file or an incremental scan, not a tweak. sv_saveloc.qc
  SV_SaveLocScanBlk.
- **A 999-row delete-all takes ~5 s** (~3.5 ms per row on the Pi: FS_Remove
  re-walks every search path to update the name hash). It sweeps 2 rows a frame
  and is harmless, just slow. Engine fs.c FS_RebuildFSHash_Update.

## Features / releases

- **Patch 427's client half is not in a release.** Clients quote `download`;
  until players update, the lobbies' server half is what lets them join maps
  with spaced sound names. Ships with the next `release.ps1 -Bump patch`.
- **Only `2` is drawn early (Patch 430).** 3/4/5/6 move the cursor and load in
  one server step and their target row is not published; the release after a
  hold still waits a round trip for the server's unfreeze (the second `prederr`
  line on each load).

## Harness coverage

- **A failed rewind on a LOBBY is untested, AND BUILD 66 AND PATCH 434 DISAGREE
  ABOUT IT.** Patch 434's void and Patch 441's latch re-scan are measured only on
  a listen server (`p434rew.cfg`, `p441void.cfg`), where the recording is
  buffered in QC strings. A lobby STREAMS, and there SV_RecRewind refuses at
  `if (e.rec_rec_stream) return FALSE` (sv_timer.qc:5967) whenever the save
  carried no snapshot -- whose own BUILD 66 comment says "the run carries on
  recording from where it is; it just does not rejoin the saved prefix". Patch
  434's branch then discards that recording (fclose + fremove of the part file)
  and Patch 441 voids the run with it. One of the two is wrong and the difference
  is a cancelled lobby run, live since the 434-438 deploy. MEASURABLE LOCALLY:
  `rec_stream 1` forces streaming off a lobby (sv_timer.qc SV_RecStreams), so an
  arm can drive it on a listen server -- which is also what makes this a to-do
  rather than a guess. Both reviewers of Patch 441 named it independently.
  sv_saveloc.qc SV_SaveApplyState (the `SV_RecRewind` else branch),
  sv_timer.qc:5546 SV_RecWritePrefix / SV_RecSnapshot. Patch 441.
- **A load the server REFUSED still tells the client to reload its sidecar.**
  SV_SaveLocLoad prints `save: the state file could not be read` and falls
  through: the body has already been placed, no rewind was attempted, and
  `SV_SaveLocEvent(e, SLOP_LOADED, id)` is still sent. The client then truncates
  its live `.view` to that slot's remembered mark, so the sidecar gets a hole
  with no `resume` record in the `.rec` to explain the jump. Reachable through
  the TOCTOU Patch 428 r1 documents (the identity check reads the file, the apply
  re-opens it). The fix wants the refusal BEFORE the placement, which is what r1
  set out to do, and an arm that produces the race. sv_saveloc.qc SV_SaveLocLoad,
  cl_replay.qc Rec_ViewLoaded. Patch 441 review.
- **The client's sidecar write-back has no reliable arm.** p438view's R2 is
  supposed to write rec_rp_view back out through Rec_ViewSaved and it only
  happens on SOME runs -- three of four, and a run from a clean tree wrote one
  while another did not, so the condition is not known. Until it is, nothing
  grades the write half of the sidecar reader: the driver reports NOT MEASURED.
  cl_replay.qc Rec_ViewSaved, cfg/test/p438view.cfg R2, tools/p438view.py
  writeback(). Patch 441.
- **p437win's W6 only covers a line job reading the SAME bytes as the open
  replay.** The arm proves the job leaves the replay's `end/window/cut/view/
  events` alone, but both files are copies of one recording, so a job whose file
  has different `stage` ticks -- or no `end` record, which would leave a
  borrowed finish tick at 0 -- is not covered. A second fixture with different
  boundaries would close it. cl_watch.qc Watch_StageSpan / Watch_LineJobStart.
  Patch 441.

## Cosmetic / low

- The replay line's alpha ramps from 1 to the `ahead` alpha across the one sample
  segment after the playhead instead of stepping (cl_lines.qc Line_Feed).
- cl_chat.qc Chat_Draw says its shadow is "like the rest of the HUD's text"; no
  other HUD text was shadowed when that was written (HUD_Text drew plain).
  Patch 440 gave the mono face an optional ring and shadow of its own, so the
  sentence is history rather than a contrast; the cost note stands.
  The shadow costs ~1.5 us a row (a second drawstring, measured 2.0 -> 3.5 us for
  62 chars).

- **Console notify on screen tints unrelated HUD text to the console's ^7 white
  when that text is drawn in extra passes.** engine/gl/gl_font.c's font batch
  colour meeting engine/client/console.c's Con_DrawNotify.  Found by Patch 440's
  arm (cfg/test/p440font.cfg, tools/p440font.py): with notify up (con_notifytime's
  default 3) and hud_font_outline 1 or 2, the speedometer's 48 px Bebas zero drew
  at (224,226,234) -- consolecolours[15], engine/client/console.c:181 -- with
  identical glyph coverage, 410 changed pixels, while every other Bebas and
  Roboto block in the frame stayed put; the same arm with `con_notifytime 0`
  grades 0.  Needs all three at once: notify on screen, this patch's extra
  drawstring passes, and a busy HUD -- a speed-only and a speed+mapinfo cfg never
  showed it, the full arm (debug + timer + energy + mapinfo) always did.  The
  mod's own harness therefore sets con_notifytime 0.  FALSIFIER: delete that line
  from p440font.cfg and grade the SPEED region -- 410 changed pixels in states
  1/2, 0 with it.  First read as glyph-atlas corruption from a second baked font
  slot; withdrawn in sh_font.qc's Patch 440 essay and in the arm's RESULT block.
  Patch 440.

- `Server permissions deny downloading file "package/maps/<map>.bsp"` on joins:
  the server advertises the map's BSP as a package and SV_AllowDownload refuses
  non-pk3 packages. The advertising side was not traced.
- A QW (engine) spectator receives the tracked player's cursor-save stats
  (STAT_FS_SLORG/SLANG, Patch 430) -- no more than the live position it watches.
- The release packet's ticks count as frozen (SV_TimerFreezeFrame); held runs are
  practice, so no board is affected.
